    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><em>Nothing</em> is more comforting than a hot, melty grilled cheese sandwich. The best grilled cheese always starts with a sturdy bread, lots of cheese and a smear of butter on the outside!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices white bread</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter <em>divided</em></li>
        <li>2 slices cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side-down onto skillet bottom and add 1 slice of cheese.</li>
        <li>Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side-up on top of sandwich.</li>
        <li>Grill until lightly browned and flip over; continue grilling until cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter and slice of cheese.</li>
    </ol>
